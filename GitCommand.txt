**********create a repository***********
git bash at the directory where you want to creat a repository
and just some normal command 
    mkdir "abc" //creat an directory
    cd "abc"    //enter the directory
    pwd //shows the present path 
finally a git command
    git init
**********commit your files to repository***********
creat some files/a file at the repository you just created(please don't use notepad.notepad++ is fine )
like def.txt
    git add def.txt
    git commit -m "added a file"
remember "add" first "commit" later. 
and it's general to add a bunch of files and commit them at one time.
