**********create a repository***********
git bash at the directory where you want to creat a repository
and just some normal command 
    mkdir "abc" //creat an directory
    cd "abc"    //enter the directory
    pwd //shows the present path 
finally a git command
    git init
**********commit your files to repository***********
creat some files/a file at the repository you just created(please don't use notepad.notepad++ is fine)
like def.txt
    git add def.txt
    git commit -m "added a file"
remember "add" first "commit" later. 
and it's general to add a bunch of files and commit them at one time.
**********check the status and diff of files***********
    git status  
    git diff
    git diff --cached
git diff compares the diff between workspace and stage
--cached sompares the diff between stage and master
**********reset the version***********
    git log
    git log --pretty=oneline
check all the the version committed, second one is shorter
    git reset --hard Head^  /return to the previous version
number of "^" represents how many version you want to roll back
or you can use head~10 instead of ten "^"
    git reflog  /shows all the command you have inputed
you could find the version and input like:
    git reset --hard 3628164
the num represents ID of version only several num at front is needed but not too less 
for it might match to several versions
